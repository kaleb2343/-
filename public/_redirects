# Redirects for Netlify Functions
# This ensures that requests to /api/functions/your-function-name
# are correctly routed to Netlify's function infrastructure.

# Catch-all for Netlify Functions, if you're using /api/ prefix in your BASE_URL
# This isn't strictly necessary if BASE_URL is correct, but can help ensure routing.
# /api/* /.netlify/functions/:splat    200

# Explicit redirect for your functions if the BASE_URL directly points to /.netlify/functions
/netlify/functions/* /.netlify/functions/:splat    200
